# Session Log: 2026-02-27T01:36 Repository Reorganization

**Date:** 2026-02-27  
**Time:** 01:36Z  
**Topic:** Repository Structure Reorganization  
**Lead Agents:** Morpheus (proposal), Dozer (execution)  
**Outcome:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Repository reorganized from unstructured root + ambiguous app versions into three-phase learning journey. **440+ files moved**, root cleaned from 15+ markdown files to 3, Git history preserved across all operations.

### Phase Structure (New)

| Phase | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `phase1-legacy-baseline/` | Get legacy .NET 2.0 Web Forms app running as-is |
| 2 | `phase2-azure-migration/` | Host on Azure App Service + SQL PaaS (minimal code changes) |
| 3 | `phase3-modernization/` | Modern API + React UI alongside legacy app |

### Major Changes

- **appV1** → `phase1-legacy-baseline/appV1-original/` (original, doesn't build)
- **appV1.5-JobsSiteWeb** → `phase1-legacy-baseline/appV1.5-buildable/` (minimal fixes, buildable)
- **appV2** → `phase3-modernization/api-dotnet/` (ASP.NET Core 6+ clean architecture)
- **appV3** → `phase3-modernization/api-python/` (Python Flask alternative)
- **iac/** → `infrastructure/` (renamed, docs consolidated to infrastructure/docs/)
- **Database/** → `database/` (lowercase consistency)
- **9 infrastructure markdown files** → `infrastructure/docs/`
- **New:** `docs/` folder for learning paths and contributing guide

### Decisions Recorded

1. Three-phase learning story is organizing principle
2. Folder names tell story without reading documentation
3. Infrastructure docs consolidated and organized
4. Root README rewritten as learning journey map
5. Each phase has clear README explaining purpose

### Team Updates

- ✅ Morpheus recorded repository structure analysis and proposal strategy
- ✅ Dozer recorded Windows Git operations and file move techniques
- ✅ Scribe writing orchestration logs and merging decision inbox
- ⏳ All agents to be notified of organizational changes

### Verification

- Git history preserved across all moves
- Root directory cleanup verified
- Phase structure validates learning story
- No files lost or corrupted

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Write orchestration logs for Morpheus and Dozer
2. ✅ Merge decision inbox to decisions.md
3. ✅ Update agent histories with organizational context
4. ✅ Update focus (now.md) to reflect next phase
5. ✅ Commit .squad/ changes
