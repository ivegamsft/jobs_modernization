# Session Log: Phase 1 Runtime Preparation

**Date:** 2026-02-28T18:30 UTC  
**Agents:** Tank (Backend Dev), Mouse (Tester)  
**Parallel work:** Infrastructure validation + Runtime testing + Test automation  

---

## Summary

Tank successfully completed Phase 1 runtime preparation: environment validation, LocalDB setup, connection string fixes, code refactoring for WAP migration, IIS Express launch, and HTTP smoke testing. Mouse delivered 5 automated build verification tests (all passing). Both agents unblocked Phase 1 testing.

## Tank's Work: Phase 1 Runtime Success

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- Environment fully functional (MSBuild, LocalDB, IIS Express, sqlpackage)
- Solution file created
- Connection strings fixed (hardcoded paths → LocalDB)
- Code refactored: App_Code → Code, ProfileCommon → JobSiteProfileBase (WAP migration)
- Database deployed: 22 tables, 157 sprocs
- App running on IIS Express with HTTP 200 on 5 pages
- **Critical gap:** Seed data files are empty (0 bytes) — blocks functional testing

## Mouse's Work: Build Verification Tests

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- 5 automated tests (BLD-001 through BLD-005)
- All passing in first run
- PowerShell script, zero external dependencies
- CI/CD ready with exit code 0/1
- Auto-detects .sln when created

**Related:** `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-02-28T18-30-mouse.md`, commit aa873dd

## Phase 1 Status

- ✅ Build (appV1.5 compiles, 0 errors)
- ✅ Runtime (app runs on IIS Express)
- ✅ Build automation (5 tests automated)
- ⏳ Functional testing (blocked on seed data)

**Next Priority:** Fill empty seed data files (Countries, States, EducationLevels, JobTypes) to enable registration/login/search testing.
