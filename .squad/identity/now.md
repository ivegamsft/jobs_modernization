# What We're Focused On

Infrastructure documentation cleaned — **14 outdated/duplicate docs deleted, 18 paths corrected**. Repository docs verified accurate. Now prioritizing infrastructure template validation and deployment blocker fixes.

**Next:** Validate Bicep/Terraform templates, fix compilation errors, test Phase 1 legacy app buildability, sequence Phase 0 validation work before Phase 1 infrastructure commit.
