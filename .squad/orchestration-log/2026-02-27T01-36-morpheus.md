# Morpheus Orchestration Log
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-27T01:36:00Z  
**Agent:** Morpheus (Lead)  
**Mode:** sync  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5  

## Outcome: APPROVED

### Work Summary
Completed full repository structure analysis and proposed comprehensive reorganization into three-phase learning journey.

### Deliverables
- **Proposal Document:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/morpheus-repo-reorg.md`
- **Analysis Scope:** 15+ loose root files, 4 ambiguous app versions (appV1/V1.5/V2/V3), 9 infrastructure docs scattered
- **Proposed Structure:** 
  - `phase1-legacy-baseline/` — Get legacy .NET 2.0 app running
  - `phase2-azure-migration/` — Host on Azure App Service + SQL PaaS
  - `phase3-modernization/` — Modern API + React UI alongside legacy app
  - `infrastructure/` — Consolidated infrastructure docs and IaC
  - `database/` — Lowercase consistency, schema + seed data
  - `specs/` — Spec-kit specifications
  - `docs/` — General learning documentation

### Key Decisions Captured
1. Three-phase learning story is the organizing principle
2. Folder names should tell the story without reading documentation
3. All infrastructure docs (9 files) consolidate to `infrastructure/docs/`
4. Clear app versioning: appV1-original, appV1.5-buildable, api-dotnet, api-python
5. Root README becomes learning journey map

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Structure maps to learning journey
- ✅ Folder names are self-documenting
- ✅ Each phase has clear purpose
- ✅ Root cleaned from 15+ files to ~3 files
- ✅ All links internally documented for re-mapping

### Next: Dozer Execution
Proposal approved for Dozer (DevOps) to execute file reorganization across 440+ files.
