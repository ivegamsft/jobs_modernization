# Dozer Orchestration Log
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-27T01:36:00Z  
**Agent:** Dozer (DevOps)  
**Mode:** sync  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5  

## Outcome: COMPLETED

### Work Summary
Executed Morpheus's approved repository reorganization. Moved 440+ files, created phase folder structure, renamed directories with Git history preservation, created 8 new README files for learning journey.

### Operations
- **Files Moved:** 440+
- **Directories Renamed:** 4 (appV1 → phase1-legacy-baseline/appV1-original, etc.)
- **New Folders Created:** phase1-legacy-baseline, phase2-azure-migration, phase3-modernization, infrastructure, docs
- **READMEs Created:** 8 (one per major folder)
- **Root Files Reduced:** 15+ → ~3 (README.md, .gitignore, core project files)
- **Git History:** Preserved across all moves (using git mv + Move-Item fallback for Windows edge cases)

### Key Techniques
- **Standard Moves:** `git mv` with full history preservation
- **Windows Case-Insensitive Renames:** Temp directory technique for Database → database
- **Content Migration:** Move-Item + git add for large directory contents
- **Verification:** `git status` checked after each phase to ensure "R" (rename) not "D+A" (delete+add)

### Implementation Details
1. Created phase1-legacy-baseline structure with appV1-original and appV1.5-buildable
2. Created phase2-azure-migration placeholder with README
3. Created phase3-modernization with api-dotnet, api-python, ui-react
4. Moved 9 infrastructure docs to infrastructure/docs/
5. Moved code analysis and modernization docs to appropriate phase folders
6. Created consolidated database/ folder (lowercase)
7. Consolidated specs/ documentation
8. Created docs/ for general learning materials

### Verification
- ✅ All files moved successfully
- ✅ Git history preserved (verified with git log --follow)
- ✅ Root directory cleaned to 3 files
- ✅ Phase structure tells learning story
- ✅ All READMEs created and populated
- ✅ No files lost or corrupted
