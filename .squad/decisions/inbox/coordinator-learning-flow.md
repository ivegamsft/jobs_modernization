### 2026-02-27T01:40:00Z: Legacy app baseline
**By:** ivegamsft (via Copilot)
**What:** appV1 is the original legacy .NET Web Forms app (web project format, doesn't build). appV1.5 adds .sln, master pages, and minimal changes to make it buildable — this is the Phase 1 working baseline. appV2 is Phase 3 modernization material. appV3 was an experiment (keep or redo).
**Why:** User clarification — defines the learning flow across versions

### 2026-02-27T01:40:00Z: Three-phase learning story
**By:** ivegamsft (via Copilot)
**What:** Phase 1 = appV1→V1.5 (get it running as-is). Phase 2 = Host on App Service + Azure SQL PaaS (minimal code changes). Phase 3 = Bolt on modern API + React UI alongside legacy app (don't rewrite, extend).
**Why:** User request — core project strategy
